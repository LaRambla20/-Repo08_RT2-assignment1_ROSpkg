# First Research Track 2 Assignment - ROS package
## Organization
This github repository contains a ROS package and the corresponding nodes documentation generated by the tool Sphinx starting from the comments in the code (link to visualize this documentation: https://larambla20.github.io/Repo08_RT2-assignment1_ROSpkg/).  
The package contains a launch file to launch a simulation environment and two nodes that realize the control modalities for the simulated robot, both to be used in the RT2 first assignment.
Head over to the repository named `Repo08_RT2-assignment1_ROSpkg` in order to be given further insights about the assignment.
